Parse Bitly Module
==================

### Link shortening module for Parse which uses Bitly

Bitly (formerly Bit.ly) is a URL shortening and bookmarking service owned by Bitly, Inc. (https://bitly.com/)

Sign up for a Bitly account at https://bitly.com/a/sign_up

There are two methods of authenticating with Bitly's API

1- OAuth access token which can be generated by visiting: https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps

OR

2- LoginName and ApiKey (deprecated) which can be generated by visiting: https://bitly.com/a/your_api_key/

    var reallyLongLink = "http://www.thisisareallylonglink.com/";
 
    var bitly = require('cloud/bitly.js'); //bitly.js must exist in your cloud directory
 
    var authToken = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN";
 
    bitly.initializeWithOAuthToken(authToken);
 
    //or you could have initialized with Login/ApiKey (deprecated)
    var login = "YOUR_LOGIN";
    var api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY";
    bitly.initializeWithLoginAndApiKey(login, api_key);
 
    //call shortenUrl, and pass the url you'd like to shorten as 'longUrl'
    bitly.shortenUrl({ longUrl : longUrl }).then(handleSuccess, handleError);
